2. **Add threat intel API keys** (optional):
   - Edit `.env`
   - Add AbuseIPDB key
   - Add Shodan key
   - Restart honeypot

3. **Deploy to production**:
   - Follow docs/DEPLOYMENT.md

## Questions?

If you have any issues with the merge or need clarification on any changes:

1. Check the detailed commit messages (both have extensive descriptions)
2. Review PROJECT_STATUS.md for implementation tracker
3. Check docs/ folder for all documentation
4. All code is tested and working - safe to merge!
